# About

Archeage is a Korean MMORPG released in 2012. In 2023, due to high demand, a classic version of the game was re-released, called 'Archeage Classic'.

This app provides a tooling interface, that allows you to view the most recent patch notes from the game, plan your commerce activities to maximize profits, and in the future: simulate regrades to plan your items and acquire mythic status quicker.

# Live

The app is currently live on AWS at http://bit.ly/aachub and will be migrated to Azure in the near future.

# Data

The data source for this app is provided from this Google spreadsheet. A big thank you to everyone in the Archeage community that contributed to it:
